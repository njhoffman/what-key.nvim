1. 💥 What Key                                   *what-key-💥-what-key*

**WhatKey** is a lua plugin for Neovim 0.5 that displays a popup with possible
key bindings of the command you started typing. Heavily inspired by the
original emacs-what-key <https://github.com/justbur/emacs-what-key> and
vim-what-key <https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-what-key>.

✨ FEATURES                                          *what-key-✨-features*


- for Neovim 0.7 and higher, it uses the `desc` attributes of your mappings as the default label
- for Neovim 0.7 and higher, new mappings will be created with a `desc` attribute
- opens a popup with suggestions to complete a key binding
- works with any setting for |timeoutlen|, including instantly (`timeoutlen=0`)
- works correctly with built-in key bindings
- works correctly with buffer-local mappings
- extensible plugin architecture
- built-in plugins:
    - **marks:** shows your marks when you hit one of the jump keys.
    - **registers:** shows the contents of your registers
    - **presets:** built-in key binding help for `motions`, `text-objects`, `operators`, `windows`, `nav`, `z` and `g`
    - **spelling:** spelling suggestions inside the what-key popup


⚡️ REQUIREMENTS                            *what-key-⚡️-requirements*


- Neovim >= 0.5.0


📦 INSTALLATION                                *what-key-📦-installation*

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

VIM-PLUG <HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/JUNEGUNN/VIM-PLUG> ~

>
    " Vim Script
    Plug 'folke/what-key.nvim'

    lua << EOF
      require("what-key").setup {
        -- your configuration comes here
        -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
        -- refer to the configuration section below
      }
    EOF
<


PACKER <HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/WBTHOMASON/PACKER.NVIM> ~

>
    -- Lua
    use {
      "folke/what-key.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("what-key").setup {
          -- your configuration comes here
          -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
          -- refer to the configuration section below
        }
      end
    }
<


⚙️ CONFIGURATION                          *what-key-⚙️-configuration*


  ❗️ IMPORTANT: the timeout when **WhatKey** opens is controlled by the vim
  setting |timeoutlen|. Please refer to the documentation to properly set it up.
  Setting it to `0`, will effectively always show **WhatKey** immediately, but a
  setting of `500` (500ms) is probably more appropriate.



  ❗️ don’t create any keymappings yourself to trigger WhatKey. Unlike with
  _vim-what-key_, we do this fully automatically. Please remove any left-over
  triggers you might have from using _vim-what-key_.



  🚑 You can run `:checkhealth what_key` to see if there’s any conflicting
  keymaps that will prevent triggering **WhatKey**

🪄 SETUP                                              *what-key-🪄-setup*

With the default settings, **WhatKey** will work out of the box for most
builtin keybindings, but the real power comes from documenting and organizing
your own keybindings.

To document and/or setup your own mappings, you need to call the `register`
method

>
    local wk = require("what-key")
    wk.register(mappings, opts)
<


Default options for `opts`

>
    {
      mode = "n", -- NORMAL mode
      -- prefix: use "<leader>f" for example for mapping everything related to finding files
      -- the prefix is prepended to every mapping part of `mappings`
      prefix = "",
      buffer = nil, -- Global mappings. Specify a buffer number for buffer local mappings
      silent = true, -- use `silent` when creating keymaps
      noremap = true, -- use `noremap` when creating keymaps
      nowait = false, -- use `nowait` when creating keymaps
    }
<



  ❕ When you specify a command in your mapping that starts with `<Plug>`, then
  we automatically set `noremap=false`, since you always want recursive
  keybindings in this case


⌨️ MAPPINGS ~


  ⌨ for **Neovim 0.7** and higher, what key will use the `desc` attribute of
  existing mappings as the default label


Group names use the special `name` key in the tables. There’s multiple ways
to define the mappings. `wk.register` can be called multiple times from
anywhere in your config files.

>
    local wk = require("what-key")
    -- As an example, we will create the following mappings:
    --  * <leader>ff find files
    --  * <leader>fr show recent files
    --  * <leader>fb Foobar
    -- we'll document:
    --  * <leader>fn new file
    --  * <leader>fe edit file
    -- and hide <leader>1

    wk.register({
      f = {
        name = "file", -- optional group name
        f = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" }, -- create a binding with label
        r = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File", noremap=false, buffer = 123 }, -- additional options for creating the keymap
        n = { "New File" }, -- just a label. don't create any mapping
        e = "Edit File", -- same as above
        ["1"] = "what_key_ignore",  -- special label to hide it in the popup
        b = { function() print("bar") end, "Foobar" } -- you can also pass functions!
      },
    }, { prefix = "<leader>" })

    -- all of the mappings below are equivalent

    -- method 2
    wk.register({
      ["<leader>"] = {
        f = {
          name = "+file",
          f = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" },
          r = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File" },
          n = { "<cmd>enew<cr>", "New File" },
        },
      },
    })

    -- method 3
    wk.register({
      ["<leader>f"] = {
        name = "+file",
        f = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" },
        r = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File" },
        n = { "<cmd>enew<cr>", "New File" },
      },
    })

    -- method 4
    wk.register({
      ["<leader>f"] = { name = "+file" },
      ["<leader>ff"] = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" },
      ["<leader>fr"] = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File" },
      ["<leader>fn"] = { "<cmd>enew<cr>", "New File" },
    })
<


**Tips:** The default label is `keymap.desc` or `keymap.rhs` or `""`, `:h
nvim_set_keymap()` to get more details about `desc` and `rhs`.

🚙 OPERATORS, MOTIONS AND TEXT OBJECTS ~

**WhatKey** provides help to work with operators, motions and text objects.


  `[count]operator[count][text-object]`



- operators can be configured with the `operators` option
    - set `plugins.presets.operators` to `true` to automatically configure vim built-in operators
    - set this to `false`, to only include the list you configured in the `operators` option.
    - see here <https://github.com/folke/what-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/what-key/plugins/presets/init.lua#L5> for the full list part of the preset
- text objects are automatically retrieved from **operator pending** key maps (`omap`)
    - set `plugins.presets.text_objects` to `true` to configure built-in text objects
    - see here <https://github.com/folke/what-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/what-key/plugins/presets/init.lua#L43>
- motions are part of the preset `plugins.presets.motions` setting
    - see here <https://github.com/folke/what-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/what-key/plugins/presets/init.lua#L20>


How to disable some operators? (like v)

>
    -- make sure to run this code before calling setup()
    -- refer to the full lists at https://github.com/folke/what-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/what-key/plugins/presets/init.lua
    local presets = require("what-key.plugins.presets")
    presets.operators["v"] = nil

🚀 USAGE                                              *what-key-🚀-usage*

When the **WhatKey** popup is open, you can use the following key bindings
(they are also displayed at the bottom of the screen):


- hit one of the keys to open a group or execute a key binding
- `<esc>` to cancel and close the popup
- `<bs>` go up one level
- `<c-d>` scroll down
- `<c-u>` scroll up


Apart from the automatic opening, you can also manually open **WhatKey** for a
certain `prefix`:


  ❗️ don’t create any keymappings yourself to trigger WhatKey. Unlike with
  _vim-what-key_, we do this fully automatically. Please remove any left-over
  triggers you might have from using _vim-what-key_.


>
    :WhatKey " show all mappings
    :WhatKey <leader> " show all <leader> mappings
    :WhatKey <leader> v " show all <leader> mappings for VISUAL mode
    :WhatKey '' v " show ALL mappings for VISUAL mode
